You specify what moral or lesson be learnt and the skill will generate a unique fable for you, complete with a high quality realistic AI generated voice narration powered by the ElevenLabs technology

# Problem we are solving

- Parents are busy and don't have time to read to their kids
- Kids are spending too much time on screens
- Kids are not learning the right values and morals
- Audiobooks and books are generally not personalized and sometimes not available when a certain values and lessons need to be taught 

# Benefits

- Kids tend to learn better in a form of a story
- Eleven Labs Cloned voice technology (as showcased in 3 out of the 7 voices) can help the little ones connect better
to the reader
- Alexa speakers is everywhere, there are over 100 million Alexa enabled devices. All mobilephones can also use Alexa via
Alexa app. Alexa Auto allows you to use Alexa in your car. Alexa is also available on many other devices such as TVs, etc.

# Features

* Up to the 7 different voices and growing, to listen to so the young ones don't get bored
* Highly optimzed audio output for Alexa devices
* Highly optimized LLM generation for Fable generation 
* Cloned voice demonstration and potential
* Ability to generate a fable with a moral of your choice for on demand learning
* Quick and no fuss way to generate a fable for the little ones
* Any other Alexa based features that comes for free, e.g. routines (playing at the same time every day), etc.

# Market, Growth and Scaling Potential

The marketing potentiial of the Alexa Skill is huge. There are over 100 million Alexa enabled devices out there and many times more users per device. 

There is none that does the personalisation that is needed for the little ones. The Alexa Skill can be easily scaled to other languages and other voices. 

One of the biggest most profitable skill on Alexa is sleep sounds. The Alexa Skill can easily be used as a bedtime story for the little ones.

Since Alexa can be installed on any mobile phones as well as built into the Amazon shopping which many people have, you can use this at home or even on the move in the car, etc!

The Alexa Skill can also be easily scaled to other devices such as Google Home, etc.

# Monetization

The Alexa Skill can be monetized in the following ways:

## Free Tier
* The Alexa Skill will be free to use for the first 2-3 number of fables per month
* Free tier will not have their stories saved

## Subscription Tier
* Subscriptions will be made available after the first few use of the skill  and will follow the Audible subscription style
* Monthly 4 credits (fables)
* All stories are saved and can be played back anytime as long as there is an active subscription
* Credits do not rollover into the next month
* Currently looking to charge 2.99 USD per month
* In future ability to submit audio for cloning

# Testing

Currently the Alexa Skill is in development mode and is not yet published (approval process may take up to a week). To
test the skill, you need to be added as a alpha/beta tester. Please contact the author to be added as a beta tester.

For a limited time during the hackathon judging period, the team have shared a testing simulator interface available at 
https://creator.voiceflow.com/prototype/64c6bcd909d04078840fdc5e

Please note that full experience can only be tested on an Alexa device and the simulator mileage varies.

The team highly suggests watching the hackathon presentation video where a live alexa demo is shown.

# Architecture

The Alexa Skill is currently created by VoiceFlow a hosted no-code platform. The backend is a NodeJS server whose source code is in this repo that does the many heavy duty lifting.
whose primary function is to make calls to the ElevenLabs API to generate the audio narration.

# Alexa Skill Front End

The Alexa Skill front end is created using VoiceFlow, a hosted no-code platform. The source code for the Alexa Skill is available in this repo under the VoiceFlow folder. Please note that Voiceflow has deprecated direct support for Alexa Skill recently so while the flow is working for this particular project, for new voiceflow accounts created you will need to do extra steps to integrate. Open an issue in this repo if you need help.

# Alexa Skill Backend Server

The Alexa front end skill (created in Voiceflow) utilizes this backend server to handle the following:

- Synthetizing of text to speech using the Eleven Labs API and returning back an AUDIO data URI
- Easy testing and experimenting with different settings to generate the best audio output
- Once the audio is generated by Eleven Labs, it is processed in real time to the format that can be played on Alexa devices and stored in an AWS S3 Bucket

Temporarily this has been hosted on glitch.com for the purpose of the hackathon. The source code is available in this repo under the root directory

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/goldzulu/faiblebudexpress.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```
   cd faiblebudexpress
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Replace `your_api_key_here` in the `.env.template` file with your Eleven Labs API key.

   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`.


## Running the Backend Server

Run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm start
```

The server will start listening on the specified port (default is 3000). You can now make a POST request to the `/synthesize` endpoint with the text and voice settings as input.

## API Endpoint

**POST** `/synthesize`

**Request Body:**

- text(required): The text to synthesize.
- voice (optional): The voice to use for synthesis. Default is '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM'.
- voice_settings (optional): An object containing additional voice settings.
  - stability (default: 0)
  - similarity_boost (default: 0)

**Response:**

Returns an object containing the synthesized audio in a data URI format.

```json
{
  "audioDataURI": "data:audio/mpeg;base64,..."
}
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, world!", "voice": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM", "voice_settings": {"stability": 0, "similarity_boost": 0}}' \
  http://localhost:3000/synthesize
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "audioDataURI": "data:audio/mpeg;base64,//uQZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
}
```
